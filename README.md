# Package operations:
  - flake8 (7.1.1)
  - prompt (0.4.1)

### “Mind Games” is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that must be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Wrong answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. Games:

    1) Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated
    2) Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
    3) Determination of an even number
    4) Determination of the greatest common divisor
    5) Definition of a prime number

The purpose of this project:
Dive into the Python ecosystem and learn how to set up a working environment. Work with flake8 (linter, code quality analyzer) and poetry dependency manager. Understand how git differs from GitHub, work with external repositories. Gain experience in building the architecture of a full-fledged application and writing clean code.
